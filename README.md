# ruboclean

**ruboclean** puts `.rubocop.yml` into order. It groups the configuration into three groups:

1. "Base"-configuration like `require`, `inherit_from`, etc.
2. `Namespaces`
3. `Namespace/Cops`

Finally it orders the configurations **alphabetically** within these groups.

## Example

### Input `.rubocop.yml`:

```yml
Rails/ShortI18n:
  Enabled: true

Layout/LineLength:
  Max: 120

Rails:
  Enabled: true

AllCops:
  Exclude:
  - path/file_exists.rb
  - path_with_files/**/*
  - path/file_does_not_exist.rb # This entry will be removed if the file doesn't exist. Skip with --preserve-paths option.
  - path_without_files/**/* # Will be removed if no files within pattern exist. Skip with --preserve-paths option.

# Preceding comments will be removed unless the --preserve-comments option is used.
require:
- rubocop-rails # Inline comments will always be removed.
```

### Output `.rubocop.yml`:

```yml
---

require:
- rubocop-rails

AllCops:
  Exclude:
  - path/file_exists.rb
  - path_with_files/**/*

Rails:
  Enabled: true

Layout/LineLength:
  Max: 120

Rails/ShortI18n:
  Enabled: true
```

### Parameters

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                           |
|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `path`                | Can be a directory that contains a `.rubocop.yml`, or a path to a `.rubocop.yml` directly. Defaults to the current working directory. |
| `--silent`            | Suppress any output displayed on the screen when executing the command.                                                               |
| `--preserve-comments` | Preserves **preceding** comments for each top-level entry in the configuration. Inline comments are **not** preserved.                |
| `--preserve-paths`    | Skips the path cleanup that are applied against `Include:` and `Exclude:` configuration.                                              |
| `--verify`            | Executes in dry-run mode. Exits with 1 if changes are needed, otherwise 0.                                                            |

### Examples

```shell
ruboclean                             # uses `.rubocop.yml` of current working directory
ruboclean /path/to/dir                # uses `.rubocop.yml` of /path/to/dir
ruboclean /path/to/dir/.rubocop.yml
```
